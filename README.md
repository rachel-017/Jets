#Jets Project

Jets Project is a project created to read information from a file, store it, and then allow the user to interact with or change the information, without changing the original file.

##Usage

The JetsApplication class is used to access all features. Once the class is run, the user will be prompted to choose from a menu, and depending on the menu number chosen, the application will run accordingly. The user can see a list of all bugs, see a list of bugs including air time by choosing "Fly all Bugs", see the fastest bug, or see the bug with the largest range. They can also add a bug to the field, by inputing the bug's model, speed, range, and price.
And remove a bug from the field by entering the number of the bug to be removed. Lastly, the user can call on all the bugs with a Pollen Pocket to go gather pollen, or all the bugs that are combat ready to go fight. When the user is ready to exit, they can select 9 to quit.

##Lessons Learned

I learned how to use Buffered Reader to read in a text file as strings, then how to manipulate those strings, so they can be turned into a Java object that can be used by another application. I also learned the importance of keeping track references using pass by value.
